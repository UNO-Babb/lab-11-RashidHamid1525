I used SimPy to drive the simulation of shoppers in a grocery store and determine 
approximately how long they wait to check out. The shoppers arrived on a regular basis, 
spent time shopping based on the number of items they had, and then joined a single 
line to checkout. Checkers were processing customers based on the number of items 
they have, and the simulation tracked wait times and idle time.

I tested different numbers of checkers, and from this, I learned that too few checkers 
provide excessively long waits while more checkers reduce the waits but increase the 
idle time. In the simulation, this helped me in clearly understanding how arrival rate,
 service speed, and length of queue affect the overall performance in a real-world system.
